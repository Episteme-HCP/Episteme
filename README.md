**Episteme** is a high-performance, modular, and comprehensive scientific computing library for Java. It reimagines JVM-based science by bridging the gap between low-level performance (C/C++) and high-level architectural elegance.

---

## 🚀 The Achievement
Developed over a relentless **4-month** sprint, Episteme comprises over **450,000+ lines** of production-ready code. This massive engineering undertaking was **built entirely with Antigravity**, demonstrating the power of agentic AI in scaling complex, science-first architectures.

---

## 🔭 The Concept: Science-First Engineering
Most libraries are "computer-oriented"—built around arrays and pointers. Episteme is **"science-oriented"**.
*   **Natural Hierarchy**: Our object model mirrors the real world. Mathematics is the base for Physics, which in turn powers Biology and the Social Sciences.
*   **Semantic Reusability**: Complex scientific concepts are readily available via deep object hierarchies, allowing you to build entire domain-specific applications in just a few prompts.
*   **HPC on par with C**: Leverages Java Panama (21+) and the Vector API for direct native performance with zero deployment overhead.

---

## ✨ Key Features
*   🏎️ **Blazing Fast**: Up to **15x faster** on double-precision operations than EJML or Apache Commons Math.
*   ♾️ **Infinite Precision**: Arbitrary-precision numbers (MPFR) and complex domains supported natively.
*   📦 **Modular & Thin**: Release modules are ~1MB; add only the dependencies and compute backends you need.
*   🧠 **Autotuning Backends**: Plug-and-play support for CUDA, OpenCL, MKL, and OpenBLAS. Backends are put into "competition" to ensure the fastest execution for your specific hardware.
*   🌐 **Distributed Grid**: Integrated worker nodes and gRPC-ready client/server architecture for scaling jobs across entire clusters.
*   🛠️ **Ready-to-Use**: Includes tens of loaders, viewers, external device drivers, and a suite of demo apps.
*   🌍 **I18n Supported**: Fully localized in English, French, German, Spanish, and Chinese (ZN).

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Installation
Add Episteme to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.episteme</groupId>
    <artifactId>episteme-core</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-beta1</version>
</dependency>
```

### High-Precision Linear Algebra
```java
// QR Decomposition with 128-bit precision
Matrix<RealBig> A = Matrix.rand(100, 100, RealBig.RING);
QRResult<RealBig> qr = A.qr();
System.out.println("Residual: " + A.subtract(qr.Q().multiply(qr.R())).norm());
```

## Architecture

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete design.
[Architecture Diagrams (Mermaid)](docs/mermaid/README.md)

**Core Principles:**

1. **Performance First**: Primitives by default, objects when needed
2. **Scientific Accuracy**: Respect mathematical and physical concepts
3. **Ease of Use**: Domain scientists shouldn't need to know lower layers
4. **Flexibility**: Switch precision/backends without code changes
